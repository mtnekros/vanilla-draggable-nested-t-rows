# VANILLA JS Draggable API
* We have a table with multiple rows
* The rows are draggable
* Draggable them up and down will change the order of the rows & the data
* Dragging them right & left will nest the rows in & out of other rows & the data
* There is extensive use of Depth First Search & Breadth First Search as the data structure demands
